# 🌐 Host a Website on Amazon S3

This project walks through hosting a static website using Amazon S3.

### 🔧 What I Did:
- Configured an S3 bucket for static website hosting
- Set permissions and made it publicly accessible
- Worked through ACLs and bucket policy
- Enabled versioning and debugged visibility issues

### 💡 Lessons Learned:
> This wasn’t just about uploading files — it helped me understand **how** and **why** cloud hosting works. I connected the dots between the front-end and AWS infrastructure.

Still early, still learning — but I’m in it. Walk with me!
