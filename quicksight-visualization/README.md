# 📊 Visualize Data with QuickSight

**Day 2 of my AWS Journey with the Nextwork Cloud Engineering Roadmap**

This project showcases how I used **Amazon QuickSight** to transform raw data into clear, actionable visuals — all within the AWS ecosystem.

Coming from a Power BI background, I’ve built dashboards before, but this time I focused on understanding how visualization works **natively in the cloud**.

## ✅ What I Did

- 📁 Uploaded the dataset and `manifest.json` file to **Amazon S3**
- 🔑 Created a QuickSight account (disabled the paid add-on)
- 🔗 Connected **S3 to QuickSight** using the manifest structure
- 📊 Explored the Netflix dataset: visualized by release year, content type, and categories
- 🧠 Filtered insights by genre (e.g., **Thrillers**, **Action & Adventure**, **TV Comedies**)
- ✏️ Customized chart titles and exported the final dashboard as a polished **PDF**
- 🔄 Refreshed and updated the dataset to fix missing country data

## ⚠️ Challenge

Connecting S3 to QuickSight using the **manifest file** was tricky at first — but once I understood the structure, it all flowed smoothly.
