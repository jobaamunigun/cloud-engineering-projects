## Introducing Today's Project!

In this project, I will demonstrate how to use Amazon QuickSight to analyze data and generate visualizations and insights from a Netflix dataset. I'm doing this project to learn how to use data cloud services for data analysis

### Tools and concepts

Services I used were QuickSight and Amazon S3. Key concepts I learnt includes editing in manifest.json files ,data visualization techniques (eg. charts, filters) and how to perform a data refresh in QuickSight

### Project reflection

This project took me approximately 2 hours + .The most challenging part was connecting my S3 datasets on QuickSight.  It was most rewarding to generate a PDF of my finished visualizations

After this project, I plan to work on Day 3 of thw AWS Challenge. I will start this project tommorow and it's about Cloud Security

## Upload project files into S3

S3 is used in this project to store two files, which are manifest.json (which tells QuickSight about the format and structure of the data i am analyzing) and netflix_titles ( which is the raw data that i am going to be analyzing) 

I edited the manifest.json file by updating S3 URL that corresponded with my dataset's file location. Itâ€™s important to edit this file because it's how QuickSight will find and analyze the data

## Create QuickSight account

Creating a QuickSight account cost $0 as it comes with a 30 days free trial. I will make sure to UNCHECK the add-on in the sign up flow called Pixel-Perfect Reports so that i don't get charged

Creating an account took me about 10-15 minutes including setting up my bucket permissions

## Download the Dataset

I connected the S3 bucket to QuickSight by visiting the datasets page. There were so many options for data sources i could connect to (databases and external tools/ platforms like salesforce ) and i selected Amazon S3 because i uploaded my datasets in S3

The manifest.json file was important in this step because it tells QuickSight how to read the data - In this project it tells  QuickSight that i uploaded a CSV file (spreadsheet) and the delimiters(i.e. commas) so that QuickSight knows how to break up the data for analysis  .Otherwise,  QuickSight might get confused and not show the data correctly

## My first visualization

To create visualizations on QuickSight, I simply had to click on the data field (e.g release_year) and QuickSight automatically generates a visualization that best suits the data.I also dragged the data into into the "Y Axis" heading to determine how my graphics should treat the data

The graph shown here is a breakdown of contents inside Netflix i.e How many TV shows/movies is released 0n XYZ year ? You can see that there is a total of 8.8K+ content pieces and 2018 is the year that has the most content amount released

I created this graph by dragging and dropping the release_year label into the Y Axis heading and dragging the type label into the Group/Color heading

## Using filters

Filters are useful for narrowing down our data to the subsets that we want to focus on and in this case i used filters to focus on the specific categories that i want to analyze.For example,I used filters to only look at the release date date from 2015 and beyond 

This visualization is a breakdown of TV shows /Movies that belong in one of the three categories - 'Action & Adventure', 'TV Comedies', here 'Thrillers', Here I added a filter based on the "listed -on" data label so that only these categories could pass the filter

## Setting up a dashboard

As a finishing touch, I updated the titles of the charts on my dashboard so that they are easily readable -Compared to the old titles the default names will simply mention the data labels e.g. released_year but the new titles communicates the purpose of the charts e.g. # of Thrillers, TV Comedies, Action & Adventure 

Did you know you could export your dashboard as PDFs too? I did this by selecting "publish" then "generate PDF" from the top right corner of the QuickSight Analysis

## Refreshing source data

In this project's extension, I downloaded fresh data that's different from my original dataset because it had rows and rows of empty country data- Analyzing incomplete data brings the risk of generating wrong insights which can lead to wrong decisions that will cost the company time ,effort and money 

Once I downloaded new data, I had to update my S3 bucket because it is still storing the previous version of the data( i.e Column F containing the Country data). I also uploaded a new manifest.json file that points to my updated datasets name ("s3://nextwork-quicksight-project-babanjoba/netflix_titles_updated.csv) .
This is to make sure that QuickSight is now pulling data from the new updated data 

I initially couldn't see my updated data in QuickSight, so I had to visit the datasets page in Quicksight and perform a full reset of my data by simply refreshing - and Viola! my visualizations were drawing from the updated data
